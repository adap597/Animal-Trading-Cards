			<p class="description">Snow leopards are smaller than most other big cats. Their large paws allow them to move stealthily and easily over snow.
				Their long thick tails, which can be up to a meter in length, allow them to balance easily while traversing their high-altitude alpine environment. 
				Unfortunately, these beautiful and elusive cats have declined in numbers due in part to habitat loss. They are considered a vulnerable species.
